<h2>Step 3: Read the ticket</h2>

<p>The helpdesk professional will read the ticket in order to gather the important details of the issue described by the user. Here the issue is that Adobe is not working.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Assess the priority of the ticket</h2>

<p>When tickets arrive, the priority will often be initially determined by the user, so it may not have been accurately assessed according to the IT department's criteria. Here, we can read that the issue is that Adobe Reader is not working. As a helpdesk professional, you can determine and set the priority. In the image, helpdesk professinal Jane Doe decided that the priority is 'High'.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Assign a ticket to an IT professional</h2>

<p>Either the queue manager or the helpdesk professional will decide who the ticket will be resolved by. They will assign the ticket to that individual. In this case, the ticket is assigned to 'Ben Lawson'. You can send the IT professional quick note as well at this point.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Determine the Service Level Agreement (SLA) level</h2>

<p>A Service Level Agreement is essentially a target for how long the ticekt will be open. Your company's will have guidelines to help you to determine this. In the image, we can see that the help desk professional has determined that Adobe not working is a Severity B, or mid-level problem.</p>

<p>

<h2>Step 7: Notify the user who created the ticket</h2>

<p>Let the user who created the ticket know that you are taking action to resolve the problem. Inform them about any pertinent details, for example, how long it might take to resolve. In the image below, we see that Jane Doe informs, Ken, the user, that she has assigned the ticket and that Ken can expect the problem to be resolved within one hour.</p>

<p>Ben, the IT professional who was assigned the ticket, has fixed the problem. He clicks 'resolved' on the ticket and adds a message to the thread informing other IT professionals that the ticket has been closed.</p>
